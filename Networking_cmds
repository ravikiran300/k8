What is the network interface configured for cluster connectivity on the master node?

Run: kubectl get nodes -o wide to see the IP address assigned to the controlplane node.

root@controlplane:~# kubectl get nodes controlplane -o wide
NAME           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
controlplane   Ready    control-plane,master   4h46m   v1.20.0   10.3.116.12   <none>        Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS   5.4.0-1041-gcp   docker://19.3.0
root@controlplane:~#

In this case, the internal IP address used for node for node to node communication is 10.3.116.12.

Important Note : The result above is just an example, the node IP address will vary for each lab.

Next, find the network interface to which this IP is assigned by making use of the ip a command:

root@controlplane:~# ip a | grep -B2 10.3.116.12
16476: eth0@if16477: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 qdisc noqueue state UP group default 
    link/ether 02:42:0a:03:74:0c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 10.3.116.12/24 brd 10.3.116.255 scope global eth0
root@controlplane:~# 

Here you can see that the interface associated with this IP is eth0 on the host

To see the interface on the host system
ip link

To see the IP Address interfaces.
ip addr
 
To connection to a network 
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0
ip addr add 192.168.1.11/24 dev eth0

To add entries into the routing table.
ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.2.1

=======================================

Gateways
==========

1)To add a default route.
ip route add default via 192.168.2.1


To check the IP forwarding is enabled on the host.
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
0


echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward


Enable packet forwarding for IPv4.
$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf


# Uncomment the line
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


To view the sysctl variables.
$ sysctl -a


To reload the sysctl configuration.
$ sysctl --system
