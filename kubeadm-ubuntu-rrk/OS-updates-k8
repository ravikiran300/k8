Let us explore the environment first. How many nodes do you see in the cluster?

Including the controlplane and worker nodes.
kubectl get nodes

==

Precheck

how many application,pods,nodes

kubectl get pods -o wide
where actual pods  hosted

==============================================

we need to take node01 out for maintenance. Empty the node of all applications and mark it unschedulable.
    Node node01 Unschedulable
    Pods evicted from node01

kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets
here pods are placed from worker node to master node. it will not resechudle after uncrondon the node

The maintenance tasks have been completed. Configure the node node01 to be schedulable again.

Run the command

kubectl uncordon node01


======================================


root@controlplane:~# kubectl describe node controlplane | grep -i  taint
Taints:             <none>
root@controlplane:~# 

Since there are no taints on the controlplane node, all the pods were started on it when we ran the kubectl drain node01 command


=============================================

We need to carry out a maintenance activity on node01 again. Try draining the node again using the same command as before: 
kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets
not worked y?


kubectl get pods -o wide and you will see that there is a single pod scheduled on node01 which is not part of a replicaset.
The drain command will not work in this case. To forcefully drain the node we now have to use the --force flag.

A forceful drain of the node will delete any pod that is not part of a replicaset.

=====================================================

hr-app is a critical app and we do not want it to be removed and we do not want to schedule any more pods on node01.
Mark node01 as unschedulable so that no new pods are scheduled on this node.

Make sure that hr-app is not affected.

Do not drain node01, instead use the kubectl cordon node01 command.
This will ensure that no new pods are scheduled on this node and the existing pods will not be affected by this operation.
