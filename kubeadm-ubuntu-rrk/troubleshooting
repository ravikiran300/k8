application failure
====================

labels not matched between pod and service

 you inspect the mysql-service, you will see that that the selector used does not match the label on the mysql pod.
 
 kubectl -n gamma describe svc mysql-service | grep -i selector
 
 kubectl -n gamma describe pod mysql | grep -i label  
 
 As you can see the selector used is name=sql001 whereas it should be name=mysql.
Update the mysql-service to use the correct selector as per the below YAML
 
 apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service
  namespace: gamma
spec:
    ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
    selector:
      name: mysql
      
      
      ======================
      
      error: 502 Bad Gateway
   Try accessing the web application from the browser using the tab called app. You will notice that it cannot connect to the MySQL database:
   
   from browser error : Environment Variables: DB_Host=mysql-service; DB_Database=Not Set; DB_User=sql-user; DB_Password=paswrd; 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'sql-user'@'10.244.1.9' (using password: YES)
   
   According to the architecture diagram, the DB_User should be root but it is set to sql-user in the webapp-mysql deployment.
Use the command kubectl -n delta edit deployments.apps webapp-mysql and update the environment variable as follows

====================================================

error in browser:  Environment Variables: DB_Host=mysql-service; DB_Database=Not Set; DB_User=sql-user; DB_Password=paswrd; 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'sql-user'@'10.42.0.18' (using password: YES) 

If you inspect the environment variable called MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, you will notice that the value is incorrect as compared to the architecture diagram:

 kubectl -n epsilon describe pod mysql  | grep MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
 
 Correct this by deleting and recreating the mysql pod with the correct environment variable as follows:
 
 spec:
  containers:
  - env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      value: paswrd
      
      ===============
      
      Also edit the webapp-mysql deployment and make sure that the DB_User environment variable is set to root as follows:
      
      pec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: DB_Host
          value: mysql-service
        - name: DB_User
          value: root
        - name: DB_Password
          value: paswrd
          
          ====================================
          
          If you inspect the web-service, you will see that the nodePort used is incorrect.
This service should be exposed on port 30081 and NOT 30088

svc web-service 
NAME          TYPE       CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
web-service   NodePort   10.102.190.212   <none>        8080:30088/TCP   3m1s
root@controlplane:~#


To correct this, delete the service and recreate it using the below YAML file:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
  namespace: zeta
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30081
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    name: webapp-mysql
  type: NodePort


2. Also edit the webapp-mysql deployment and make sure that the DB_User environment variable is set to root as follows:

spec:
      containers:
      - env:
        - name: DB_Host
          value: mysql-service
        - name: DB_User
          value: root
        - name: DB_Password
          value: paswrd


3. The DB_Password used by the mysql pod is incorrect. Delete the current pod and recreate with the correct environment variable as per the snippet below:

spec:
  containers:
  - env:
    - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      value: paswrd

Once the objects are recreated, and you should be able to access the application.
