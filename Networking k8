switch is connect two different system
router is to connect two different networks
is network is a room then gateway is the door to a network-> to existing routing config in a system run route command(display kernel routing tables)

to reach the other network u need to routing configuration in router using the command 
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
here 192.168.1.1 is system A 
here 192.168.2.0/24 is system C

suppose u dont what network u need to  need route to your network you can set it as
ip route add default via 192.168.2.1
default is also same as 0.0.0.0
both are same
u can check this by firing route command

but sometime connecting from one network to another network is have issue related to packet forwarding
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward(0) by default
set to 1 packets forward and modity in /etc/sysconf file


ip link to check interfaces between the network
